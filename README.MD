I made this game in order to gain an experience in game development specifically with Phaser JS Framework since im somehow already a 
bit familiar with Javascript-based framework.  I made this based on around 6 hours tutorial and the the mentor was very detail oriented
in explaining concept so i got a good grasp of understanding in fundamental level thing that you could've done using this framework, 
such as real application of OOP, asset preloading, arcade physics concept, object positioning, scene management, best practices, and much 
more.

I also decided to publish it on FB Instant Game, which you could try on :
https://www.facebook.com/instantgames/play/3676441812485609/?context_type=SOLO&source=facebook~link~fb_gg_link
originally i want to try to host it on github pages/heroku but i couldn't find good resource guide yet so i just try following the mentor's
way of deploying, which is on FB Instant, and in my opining the publishing part was kind of the most confusing haha. I also accidentally
deleted the git files on this repository so i update the code with the FB Instant script on another repo:
